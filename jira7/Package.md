# Ballerina Jira Endpoint

This Ballerina client endpoint allows to connect to [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.jira.com), an online issue-tracking database. It provides bug tracking, 
issue tracking, and project management functions.
The endpoint uses the [JIRA REST API version 7.2.2](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/7.2.2/) to connect to JIRA, work with JIRA projects, 
view and update issues, work with jira user accounts, and more.

### Why do you need the REST API for Jira

The Jira REST API is an ideal solution for the developers who want to integrate JIRA with other standalone or web applications, 
and administrators who want to script interactions with the JIRA server. Because the Jira REST API is based on open 
standards, you can use any web development language to access the API.


The following sections provide information on how to use Ballerina Jira endpoint.

- [Getting started](#getting-started)
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Working with Jira Endpoint Actions](#working-with-jira-endpoint-actions)



## Getting started


- Install the ballerina distribution from [Ballerina Download Page](https://ballerinalang.org/downloads/).

- Clone the repository by running the following command

   > git clone https://github.com/wso2-ballerina/package-jira
 
- Import the package as a ballerina project.

- Provide the Ballerina directory as project SDK

## Authentication

> **Note -** 
*JIRAâ€™s REST API is protected by the same restrictions which are provided via JIRAs standard web interface.
This means that if you do not have valid jira credentials, you are accessing JIRA anonymously. Furthermore, 
if you log in and do not have permission to view something in JIRA, you will not be able to view it using the 
Ballerina JIRA Endpoint as well.*

Ballerina Jira endpoint currently provides basic authentication as the authentication method.  
Please follow the following steps to authenticate your endpoint.
     
- Obtain your Jira user account credentials(username and password).
  If you currently dont have a Jira account, you can create a new Jira account from 
  [JIRA Sign-Up Page](https://id.atlassian.com/signup?application=mac&tenant=&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.atlassian.com).

- Provide the credentials to your endpoint in the initialization step, as shown 
in the following sample code.
```Ballerina

      import wso2/jira7;
          
      //Creation of endpoint endpoint
      endpoint jira7:Client jiraEndpointEP {
          url:"https://support-staging.wso2.com",
          httpClientConfig:{
              auth:{
                  scheme:"basic",
                  username:"username",
                  password:"passord"
              }
          } 
      };

```

## Working with Jira endpoint actions

All actions of Jira Endpoint are **single-return type actions**, which will returns either response or an error.
Response can be either a `ballerina record` or a boolean value,depending on the context.
Error response is also a ballerina record of type`JiraEndpointError`. 

If a action was successfull, then the requested struct object or boolean `true` response will be returned or otherwise 
will returns an Endpoint error with error message,error type and cause.

### Example
* Request 
```ballerina
   import wso2/jira7;
       
   //Creating the jira Endpoint as an endpoint
   endpoint jira7:Client jiraEndpointEP {
        url:"https://support-staging.wso2.com",
        httpClientConfig:{
            auth:{
                scheme:"basic",
                username:"username",
                password:"passord"
            }
        }
   };
   
   jira:JiraEndpointError jiraError = {};
   jira:Project project = {};
   string projectKey = "RRDEVSPRT";    
   //Endpoint Action
   var result = jiraEndpoint -> getProject(projectKey);
   match result{
       jira:Project p => project = p;
       jira:JoraEndpointError e => jiraError = err;
   }
    
```

* Response Object
```ballerina
public type Project {
    string self;
    string id;
    string key;
    string name;
    string description;
    string leadName;
    string projectTypeKey;
    AvatarUrls avatarUrls;
    ProjectCategory projectCategory;
    IssueType[] issueTypes;
    ProjectComponentSummary[] components;
    ProjectVersion[] versions;
}
```

* Error Object
```ballerina
public type JiraEndpointError {
    string message;
    error? cause;
    string ^"type";
    json jiraServerErrorLog;   
}
```
