# Ballerina Jira Connector
This Ballerina client Connector allows to connect to [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.jira.com), an online issue-tracking 
database. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions.
The Connector uses the [JIRA REST API version 7.2.2](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/7.2.2/) to 
connect to JIRA, work with JIRA projects, view and update issues, work with jira user accounts, and more. 
It also provides auto completion and type conversions.  

## Compatibility

| Ballerina Version | Jira REST API Version |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
|0.970.0-beta3|7.2.2|

## Getting started

- Refer `https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/` to download Ballerina and install tools.

- Ballerina Jira connector currently provides basic authentication as the authentication method. Therefore obtain your 
  Jira user account credentials(username and password).If you currently dont have a Jira account, you can create a new Jira account from 
  [JIRA Sign-Up Page](https://id.atlassian.com/signup?application=mac&tenant=&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.atlassian.com).
    > **Note -** 
    *JIRAâ€™s REST API is protected by the same restrictions which are provided via JIRAs standard web interface.
    This means that if you do not have valid jira credentials, you are accessing JIRA anonymously. Furthermore, 
    if you log in and do not have permission to view something in JIRA, you will not be able to view it using the 
    Ballerina JIRA Connector as well.*

- Create a new Ballerina project by executing the following command.
  
  `<PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY>$ ballerina init`
  
- Import the jira package to your Ballerina program as follows.This will download the jira7 artifacts from the 
`ballerina central` to your local repository.

```ballerina
   import wso2/jira7;
```

- Provide the credentials to your endpoint in the initialization step, and use as shown 
in the following sample code.

```ballerina
   import wso2/jira7 as jira;
   
   function main(string... args) { 
     
       //Creating the jira endpoint
       endpoint jira:Client jiraEndpoint {
            url:"https://support-staging.wso2.com/jira",
            httpClientConfig:{
                auth:{
                    scheme:"basic",
                    username:"username",
                    password:"password"
                }
            }
       };
       
       jira:JiraConnectorError jiraError = {};
       jira:Project project = {};
       string projectKey = "RRDEVSPRT";    
       //Endpoint Action
       var result = jiraEndpoint -> getProject(projectKey);
       match result{
           jira:Project p => project = p;
           jira:JiraConnectorError e => jiraError = err;
       }
   }
    
```
